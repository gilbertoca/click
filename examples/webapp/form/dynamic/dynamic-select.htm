This example demonstrates how to dynamically add fields to a form through a
select control.
<ul>
    <li>
        The form is submitted using the JavaScript statement, <code>form.submit()</code>,
        which is set as the Select <code>onchange</code> handler. Changing the select
        option will submit the form. On the server, Form
        <code>validation</code> is switched off through, <code>Form.setValidate(false)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The utility method <code>ClickUtils.bind(Form)</code> is used to bind
        and inspect the Select value <code>before</code> the page onProcess event.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the selected value is "Property", an address fieldset is added to the form.
        If the selected value is "Stocks", an amount field is added to the form.
    </li>

</ul>
